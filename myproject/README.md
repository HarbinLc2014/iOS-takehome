# This app is developed using expo.

## For installing expo, refer to https://expo.io/learn or `npm install expo-cli --global`

## After installing expo, in terminal, cd into 'myproject' directory. Run command `yarn` to install relative packages and libraries.

## After installing all dependencies, run `expo start --tunnel` to start build the project.

## You can now run iOS simulator in the browser and check the task.

### Strongly recommend to run the project in iOS simulator(as it was previously developed in iOS mode).
